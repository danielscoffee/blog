## Welcome 

Hey there! I'm Daniel, a developer and indie hacker.

This is my personal space where I write about:

- **Programming** — tips, tutorials, and deep dives
- **Technology** — tools, frameworks, and best practices  
- **Personal projects** — things I'm building and learning

Feel free to explore the posts below and don't forget to grab a coffee!
